            <h2>An Alternative To Our Impending WALL-E Future</h2>
            <p>There is not such thing as the past or future. There is only the present. What we call past and future are a series of presents strung together.</p>
            <br>
            <p>It is often said, by people who have not studied history, that it repeats. This could not be further from the truth. Consider what would happen if you went to the fridge, took out an egg, and dropped it on the floor. Now consider what would happen if you took out a second egg and dropped it on the floor too. What happened when you dropped the first egg had no effect on what happened when you dropped the second.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Likewise, people say that they did some thing because of some other thing that came before, this is untrue in the same way that it would be untrue to say that dropping the first egg caused you to drop the second. In short, we think our previous presents causally effect our current present, when in reality the second egg broke because we chose to drop it—only drawing the connection to the first egg as a justification after the fact. We do what we want to do, then make up our reasons later.</p>
            <br>
            <p>When it comes to technology, we are rapidly approaching a WALL-E future. Apps are designed to be as addictive as possible with as little content provided as possible. They’re skinner boxes designed to highjack our brain’s ancient reward structure for profit. They use variable reward structures to literally addict us. They are often free because our data is stripped to sell to the highest bidder. They claim to be for promoting connection, when they really create conflict. What garners the most attention? Conflict, violence, antagonization. It is no wonder that despite the world never being safer statistically, when asked people describe it as much more dangerous than the past.</p>
            <br>
            <p>It’s not hard to figure out the end stage of this. What happens with any addiction, left untreated, is dependance. Being dependent is not in itself a bad thing. We depend on our friends, family, and loved ones, which is healthy. But it becomes harmful when the goals of the dependent and the dependee are not the same.</p>
            <br>
            <p>When I fill my car with gasoline, my goal is to convert my money into fuel and the goal of Exxon is to convert their fuel into money. The only misalignment is that I want to get as much fuel for as little money and they want as much money for as little fuel, which is more or less solved through competition and regulation. All things considered, this is a symbiotic relationship. I get fuel because I want fuel more than money, and they get money because they want money more than fuel.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Where this relationship becomes perverse is when our goals are not the same. Take for instance online dating. My goal is to find a partner and the company’s goal is to maximize profitability for shareholders. A dating app could actually lose money by if they match people together too well.</p>
            <br>
            <p>If I designed an app that you put all your information into and it found your perfect lover on the first try, I would lose money compared to if I instead designed my app to sprinkle enough almost matches so that you would go on dates, and perhaps have a relationship for some months, but it would almost certainly end because you were matched with the wrong person. I would make sure to divvy out the matches at random, unpredictable intervals, to get you addicted in the same way slot machines work, and finally I would try to sell you a premium subscription that would of course improve the number of dates you had, but since I want you to be subscribed forever, the dates never will be too good.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Let me be clear. I’m not against making money. I want to make a ton of it. I want to have so much money I start throwing it away because it’s taking up too much space. But if it cannot be done in a beneficent way, I firmly believe that it should not be done. Your wallet is a reflection of your values. If you earn your money through war, do not expect it to bring you peace.</p>
            <br>
            <p>So, while the problem is complex, the solution is simple. This is how we avoid the WALL-E future that anyone with eyes can see coming: Design products in a way that if the consumer had the same expert knowledge that you have, they would use your product gladly, and charge them for it. If you don’t want to break any more eggs, stop dropping them on the ground.</p>
