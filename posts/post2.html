            <h2>JavaScript</h2>
            <p>I have spent the last week learning the basics of JavaScript. It's been difficult to get into the flow of it. </p>
            <br>
            <p>My background is in python. It has its drawbacks (what doesn't?) but it's flow is very intuitive. You tell the computer do this, then that. It's essentially a flowchart.</p>
            <br>
            <p>JavaScript is different. The focus is on creating objects, then having the objects do things. The benefit is obvious for large data sets.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Eventually I'll be able to automate large portions of this blog like making posts and having the data pushed into a predefined format. There is more to come, but for now I must master the basics.</p>
