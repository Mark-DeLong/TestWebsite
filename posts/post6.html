            <h2>Bitcoin For People Who Don't Give A Shit</h2>
            
            <h3>What is bitcoin</h3>
            <br>
            <p>According to the creator, bitcoin is “peer to peer electronic cash.” There’s a lot of meaning in those five words, so let’s break it down.</p>
            <br>
            <h4>Peer to peer:</h4>
            <br>
            <p>Bitcoin is peer to peer. This is how bitcoin is organized and the rules are decided on. With a currency like the Dollar, there is a 3rd party called the Federal Reserve who is in charge of how many Dollars there are, how they are secured, the rate that they are produced & lent, and much more. Bitcoin is not like that at all.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Put simply, Bitcoin exists because people use it. Imagine an excel spreadsheet of transactions that you share with a billion people in the cloud. You can edit the spreadsheet (make a transaction), but only if the majority of people think that the new transaction is following the rules. If it does, the edit is accepted, if not it is rejected.</p>
            <br>
            <p>If a new feature comes out, or if someone wants to change the rules for how transactions are accepted by the network, anyone can make a change to their copy of Bitcoin, but it only becomes a change for everyone if the majority of users accept the change and use it for their copy of Bitcoin too.</p>
            <br>
            <p>It’s very similar to voting on a law. But instead of having police enforce the new rule, enforcement is based on usage. If you use a new feature or stick with the old version of Bitcoin, that is your vote for how the network should work.</p>
            <br>
            <h4>Electronic:</h4>
            <br>
            <p>Bitcoin is electronic cash. There is no physical thing it is tied to, it is not pegged to the value of gold, and you are not buying shares in a company. What gives it value is that it is used, and that it is secure (it cannot be counterfeited and transactions cannot be undone).</p>
            <br>
            <h4>Cash:</h4>
            <br>
            <p>Bitcoin is cash. Bitcoin is not a share, stock, check, or IOU. It is used the same way that you use paper money. If you’re selling pizzas and I give you a $20 bill, maybe you check for the watermark, or use an anti counterfeit marker to check that it is real, but once you’re convinced that the bill is real, you give me the pizza. Physical possession allows you to use bitcoin.</p>
            <br>
            <p>With Bitcoin, ownership is irrelevant for usage in the same way it is for paper money. As a legal matter, obviously there can be consequences for theft, just like with paper money. But as a matter of security, treat your Bitcoin wallet the same way you would treat your normal wallet. If you lose it, it’s possible you might not get it back. If someone steals it, it’s possible that you won’t get it back.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Bitcoin can be very safe to use. And it can also be very unsafe to use. This is not a dedicated article on security, but a few good rules of thumb are:</p>
            <br>
            <p>Be aware of general online safety. If you would’t trust the internet connection or website to enter in your banking details or credit card info, don’t use it for Bitcoin either.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Don’t send Bitcoin to people you’ve never met or before you’ve received a good/service.</p>
            <br>
            <p>There are many ways to keep bitcoin safe. If you don’t know what you’re doing, a custodial exchange is a good place to start. A service like <a href="https://coinbase.com" >Coinbase</a> is basically a Bitcoin bank and your deposits are FDIC insured.</p>
            <br>
            <p>If you are more advanced and want to embrace the crypto ethos of “be your own bank,” using a hardware wallet like a <a href="https://trezor.io" >Trezor</a> or <a href="https://www.ledger.com" >Ledger</a> is a great place to start. These devices make all the secret keys on the device itself so the sensitive info is never on the internet.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>How they interplay</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Bitcoin is a financial system where the rules are decided democratically, that is completely digital, that should be used like paper money. Peer to peer electronic cash.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Where does it come from </h3>
            <br>
            <p>Bitcoin is created very much like how gold is mined. If you want some gold, there’s 3 ways you could get it.</p>
            <br>
            <p>For most people, the easiest way is to buy it. You’d figure out the kind of gold you’d like—physical bullion, jewelry, or paper gold—and go to whoever sells the kind you’re looking for and purchase it.</p>
            <br>
            <p>For Bitcoin, there are all sorts of sellers. Which one you go it is determined by why you are buying. There are all sorts of financial instruments for investors. Hedge funds for people who want some exposure. Places where you can buy tiny amounts, and places where you can buy huge amounts.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The second way is to work for it. Bitcoin’s primary purpose is to be a medium of exchange. And if you are a creator or employer—much like how there is no reason why you couldn’t accept gold as payment—you can accept Bitcoin for payment too. You can obviously use Bitcoin to transact directly, but there are all sorts of <a href="https://bitpay.com" >services</a> that allow merchants to accept Bitcoin  and have it converted to Dollars, which could be a great way to accommodate new kinds of customers without having to expose your business to the price volatility of Bitcoin.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The last way to get Bitcoin is to mine it. Much like how mining gold requires specialized hardware and has a ton of competing miners, Bitcoin uses specialized equipment to mine it too. Whether this is a way you’d be interested in using to obtain Bitcoin depends on things like the price of electricity in your region and the scale at which you’d like to do it.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Small scale mining is essentially dead for Bitcoin. Other cryptocurrencies like ethereum and Monero can definitely be mined with graphics cards and cpu’s on consumer grade computers. I would’t expect to make a ton of money, but it can be a fun hobby that gets your computer to pay for its own upgrades.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Bitcoin mining uses ASIC’s (application specific integrated circuits), which are basically computers that are really good at mining Bitcoin, but bad at everything else. They can cost thousands of dollars, take weeks to arrive from china, and when the new model comes out, essentially become paperweights.</p>
            <br>
            <p>For large scale operations, i’d recommend talking directly to a manufacturer of ASICs like bitamain https://www.bitmain.com , that’s beyond the scope of this article and if you’re considering starting a mining farm you’re probably more advanced than what I am writing for.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>How does it work</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Bitcoin is a network of computers. When you make a transaction, someone’s computer is doing some work to validate and broadcast the transaction to everyone else in the network. Having a lot of people do this is what keeps the network secure because the more people making sure that transactions are valid, the harder it is to cheat.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Doing this takes up a lot of space and uses a lot of electricity. So, to incentivize having a lot of miners, they are paid two ways. The person making the transaction is charged a fee. This is sort of like how a bank charges a fee to do a wire transfer, Venmo charges a few dollars to make withdrawals, or how credit cards charge merchants a few percent every transaction.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The other way miners are paid, is called a “block reward.” When a new batch of transactions are broadcast to the network (about every 10 minutes), some new Bitcoins are created in the process and given to the miner who broadcasts them first. It’s essentially like a lottery.</p>
            <br>
            <p>This is sort of like how if you went digging for gold, it’s fairly random because you don’t know exactly where it is. But, you can increase the odds of you finding gold by hiring a lot of people to dig for you.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Bitcoin miners usually have many computers working together to increase their luck. Because it is a winner take all system, many smaller miners team up in what is called a “mining pool.” When one of them is successful, they all split the reward.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The block reward was originally 50 Bitcoins. Every 210,000 blocks (roughly 4 years of transactions), the reward is cut in half. At the time of writing it is 12.5 Bitcoin and is estimated to be 0 in the year 2140. This means that there will never be more than 21 Million Bitcoins.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Why is it secure</h3>
            <br>
            <p>There are many technical reasons why Bitcoin is secure, but the most important thing to know is something called “proof of work.”</p>
            <br>
            <p>When you are mining Bitcoin, your computer is doing some complex math to prove that what you are doing is following the rules. Think of a Rubik’s cube. It takes a long time to solve one, but seconds to mess it up into a unique pattern. The work that is done for each Bitcoin transaction is a lot like this. Computers spends about ten minutes trying to find the correct number (solve the Rubik’s cube), and when one of the computers gets the correct solution the one who solved it gets the Block Reward and they start working on the next one (the Rubik’s cube gets randomly shuffled again).</p>
            <br>
            <p>This is called “proof of work.” The key thing to remember is that to make more Bitcoins, you always have to do this each time, which takes time and costs money in electricity.</p>
            <br>
            <p>In theory, someone with 51% of the computer power of the Bitcoin network could rewrite the history of transactions to give themselves as many Bitcoins as they wanted. But this is never going to happen because of the time element of mining.</p>
            <br>
            <p>If I wanted to most recent transaction, I would have to rewrite that transaction, the current transaction, and the next few transactions to get ahead of the 49% honest miners. It might take an hour to rewrite the previous 10 minutes. I would be redoing work that had already been done and using electricity without making any money until I got ahead. If I wanted to rewrite a transaction from yesterday, it could take a week. A transaction from last week, a month. A transaction from last year, a decade. All without making a profit until I was in the lead, and all in public where everyone can see.</p>
            <br>
            <p>It is more profitable for Bitcoin miners to play by the rules than to cheat. Because even if someone had the computer power to highjack the network and the money to sustain an attack for weeks or months, people would abandon the network. No one would use Bitcoin if one person had the ability to undo any transaction and give themselves as many as they wanted. Their stolen Bitcoins would be worthless.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Why should I care</h3>
            <br>
            <p>If you live in the west, you don’t really need Bitcoin. You have access to global finance, live in a country with a relatively stable, uncorrupt government, with robust legal systems, and use currencies with relatively low levels of inflations.</p>
            <br>
            <p>However, this is not the case for everyone globally. This is not an exhaustive critique of banking, but some of the biggest problems with western banking is that it relies on having an uncorrupt, stable government, robust legal systems, and low levels of inflation.</p>
            <br>
            <p>We can do accounting in Dollars or Euros because the value of these currencies are relatively stable. We could have a decade long lease, and while there is some amount of inflation, it is small and predictable. You could charge me $1000 + 2%/year as a monthly rent and be pretty certain that in a decade the amount of purchasing power will be about the same.</p>
            <br>
            <p>If for some reason I break our agreement and stop paying, you have access to a legal system that—despite it’s many, many faults—at it’s core is designed to protect the rights of the individual and works for most people most of the time. In spite of all its expense, slowness, and bias, if I break a legal contract you can be confident that there will be recourse.</p>
            <br>
            <p>And if you’re not breaking a law, you can rest easy knowing that the government is not going to confiscate your deposits and you have insurance to protect you even if your bank fails. You can transact with anyone you wish, for any legal reason you wish, with no thought of the government or any third party for that matter. If you want to invest, you can do it in any foreign market. And if at the end of the day you want to start fresh in a new country, you can take your money with you.</p>
            <br>
            <p>This isn’t a defence of western banking; this is merely to say for all of its flaws—of which there are many—westerners have no need for Bitcoin. For most westerners it is another kind of exotic investment. People who use Bitcoin in the west are probably ideologically motivated, because it is a slow, expensive system, that you have to go out of your way to use, that opens you up to all kinds of fraud.</p>
            <br>
            <p>But there are places in this world where the government is corrupt. There are places in this world where the legal system is designed to protect those in power. There are places in this world where the currency has wild, unpredictable inflation.</p>
            <br>
            <p>There are places where you cannot easily invest outside of your own country. There are places where it is illegal to leave the country with your lifesavings, so, being persecuted, people have no choice but to abandon everything that they own to be able to make it through a checkpoint. There are entire classes of people that it is illegal for them to own property.</p>
            <br>
            <p>It is for these people, in these places, for whom Bitcoin was created. If you can memorize 12 words, there is no border that can stop you from crossing it with your money. There is no law that can prevent you from owning it, or tell you who you can or cannot trade with. And while prices do swing drastically with the market, there is never going to be more than 21 million Bitcoins; after all, there are people in places where losing 50% of their banks value overnight would be a breath of fresh air.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Bitcoin is peer to peer electronic cash.</p>
