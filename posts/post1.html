            <h2>Hello World</h2>
            <p>Welcome to my blog. I've been messing around for years with programming - html/css, java, and python mostly. But now I want to get serious. It is a fun hobby, but I want to actually get good enough to get work doing it.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I updated the color scheme from a generic place holder to white on blue on red. It's gaudy as all hell, but its mine and I like it.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I feel like I understand web development technically, but so much of this is design oriented. I have a very functional mindset, so this will be hard for me. "Does it work?" has been my driving question, but now I must ask myself "Does it also look attractive?"</p>
            <br>
            <p>I definitly need to study up on some color theory. But look at those damn navigation buttons! They pop up and just barely kiss! I used "transition: transform" and "transition: scale" to get it so they pop up super fast and gently fall back down.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The tree of life image I used for the logo is just a stock image now. In the future I'll put something more topical or at least crop out the borders.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I decided to use netlify for hosting because its free and you can just push changes to github and they automatically get updated. It's super cool and I'd highly recommend it. Perhaps in the future I'll get a custom domain and learn how to host it myself if this ever get's enough traffic to warrant that, but for now free is the name of the game, and it just works.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I'm gonna start learning javascrip soon. I'm pretty excited because you can create much more powerful websites compared to html/css. So look forward to that! I'm not sure what I'll do with it, but I'm sure I'll figure something out.</p>
