            <h2>Bitcoin For People Who Don't Give A Shit</h2>
            <p>If you live in the west, you don’t really need Bitcoin. You have access to global finance, live in a country with a relatively stable, uncorrupt government, with robust legal systems, and use currencies with relatively low levels of inflations.<br><br><a href="/posts/post6.html" >Read More</a></p>

            <h2>Humans Are The Weakest Link</h2>
            <p>I watched a lecture on cryptography the other day. Not realizing just how big of a number 2^256 is, I decided surely it can’t be that hard to make a program to solve for any random number between 0 and 115 ,792 ,089 ,237 ,316 ,195 ,423 ,570 ,985 ,008 ,687 ,907 ,853 ,269 ,984 ,665 ,640 ,564 ,039 ,457 ,584 ,007 ,913 ,129 ,639 ,936.

            <h2>JavaScript Classes</h2>
            <p>JavaScript has been kicking my ass lately, but in a good way. I have been learning to manipulate data. It’s still in the abstract phase now. However, I can confidently manipulate all sorts of data in arrays and objects, create classes and sub/pseudo classes.<br><br><a href="/posts/post3.html" >Read More</a></p>

            <p>Welcome to my blog. I've been messing around for years with programming - html/css, java, and python mostly. But now I want to get serious. It is a fun hobby, but I want to actually get good enough to get work doing it.<br><br><a href="/posts/post1.html" >Read More</a></p>
